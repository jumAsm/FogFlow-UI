  Fog Flow – Environmental Monitoring Dashboard (UI Concept)
</h2>

**Fog Flow** is a modern UI/UX dashboard concept I designed for a **hackathon project** focused on fog-harvesting in the Asir region.  
The design highlights how environmental and sustainability data can be presented clearly, calmly, and beautifully.

### About the Design

It simulates real-time data such as fog density, visibility, and collected water — all displayed in a balanced and intuitive layout.
